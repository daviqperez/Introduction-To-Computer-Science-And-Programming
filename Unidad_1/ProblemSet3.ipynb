    "implementation of wordgame:  This game is a lot like Scrabble or Text Twist. Letters are dealt to players, who then construct one or more words out of their letters. Each valid word receives a score, based on the length of the word and the letters in that word.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dealing**\n",
    "* A player is dealt a hand of n letters chosen at random (assume n=7 for now).\n",
    "* he player arranges the hand into as many words as they want out of the letters, but using each letter at most once.\n",
    "* Some letters may remain unused (these won’t be scored). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Scoring**\n",
    "* The score for the hand is the sum of the score for the words times the length of the word.\n",
    "* The score for a word is the sum of the points for letters in the word, multiplied by the length of the word, plus 50 points if all n letters are used on the first go.\n",
    "* Letters are scored as in Scrabble; A is worth 1, B is worth 3, C is worth 3, D is worth 2, E is worth 1, and so on. The dictionary **SCRABBLE_LETTER_VALUES** maps each lowercase letter to its Scrabble letter value.  \n",
    "* For example, ‘weed’ would be worth 32 points ((4+1+1+2)*4=32), as long as the hand actually has 1 ‘w’, 2 ‘e’s, and 1 ‘d’.\n",
    "* As another example, if n=7 and you get ‘waybill’ on the first go, it would be worth 155 points ((4+1+4+3+1+1+1)*7=105, +50) for the bonus of using all seven letters). "
